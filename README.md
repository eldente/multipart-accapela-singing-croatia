# Klapa | Multipart accapela singing from Southern Croatia

#### Definition
Klapa singing is a multipart singing tradition of the southern Croatian regions.
The leader of each singing group is the first tenor, followed by several tenori, baritoni and basi voices.
The main aim is to achieve the best possible blend of voices. 

#### Singing technique (basics)
Technically, klapa singers express their mood by means of open guttural, nasal sotto voce and falsetto singing, usually in high-pitched tessitura. 
Another feature is the ability to sing freely, without the help of notation. 
Topics of klapa songs usually deal with love, life situations, and the environment in which they live. 

#### Singers
Bearers and practitioners are skilled amateurs who inherit the tradition from their predecessors.
